#ALX Backend-Storage
<hr>

## INTRODUCTION

**Backend storage systems are designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate large amounts of data, providing reliability, scalability, and performance. These systems can be implemented using various technologies and architectures, depending on the specific requirements of the application.

One common approach to backend storage is to use a relational database management system (RDBMS). RDBMSs such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle provide a structured way to organize and store data in tables with predefined schemas. They offer robust data integrity, transaction support, and powerful querying capabilities using SQL (Structured Query Language). RDBMSs are suitable for applications that require complex data relationships and require strong consistency guarantees.**

**Backend storage is typically accessed and manipulated by the backend application through a data access layer or an application programming interface (API). This layer abstracts the underlying storage system, providing a standardized interface for the application to interact with the data.**
